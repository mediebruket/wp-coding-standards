## Usage

Check manually by running PHPCS from command line and specify the coding standard:

```bash
vendor/bin/phpcs --standard="Mediebruket" <path>
```

### PHPStorm Setup

Alternatively, the coding standard can be enabled in Phpstorm.

Phpstorm needs to know where PHP_CodeSniffer is located. Navigate to **Languages & Frameworks > PHP > Quality tools > PHP_CodeSniffer** and
specify the path the `phpcs` executable in your `vendor` directory by clicking **â€¦** . Additionally, you can add the
path to `phpcbf` as well.

Then you'll have to specify the coding standard. Navigate to **Editor > Inspections > PHP > Quality tools > PHP_CodeSniffer validation > Options > Coding standard**.
Chose the preferred coding standard from the options section.
